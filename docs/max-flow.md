### Overview

> An implementation of Dinic's algorithm for computing the maximum flow of a flow network

### Usage

- `Flow(int n)`: Constructs a `Flow` object on a network with `n` nodes and `0` edges
- `addEdge(int u, int v, int c)`: Adds a directed edge from `u` to `v` with capacity `c`
- `maxFlow(int s, int t)`: Returns the maximum flow from `s` to `t`

### Example
